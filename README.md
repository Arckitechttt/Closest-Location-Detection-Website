# Closest Location Detection Website
Developed a website (for demonstration purposes only) capable of identifying the nearest branch of an **XXXX Company** (the company doesn't intend its name to be displayed here) based on a specific inputted location.

**Haversine Formula** method was used to calculate distances between all of the company's branches to a specific inputted location on the HTML form. This website was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only.
