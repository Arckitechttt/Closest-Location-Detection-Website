# Closest Location Detection Website
Developed a website (for demonstration purposes only) capable of identifying the nearest branch of an **XXXX Company** (the company doesn't intend its name to be displayed here) based on a specific inputted location.

**Haversine Formula** method was used to calculate distances between all of the company's branches to a specific inputted location on the HTML form. This website was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only.

To ensure the company's privacy, the previously mentioned "Company's Branches" will now be denoted by the following list of locations: (assume the list of locations below represents the branches of the company) :
1. National Museum of Indonesia -- -6.176363051631948, 106.82153088532345
2. Central Jakarta Mayor Office -- -6.173024407925739, 106.81903106649357
3. Juanda Station -- -6.166533478050184, 106.83047021360103
4. Gedung Pertunjukan Wayang Orang Bharata -- -6.172181694425004, 106.84094195302518

For instance, if you input the location data for the **National Monument** on the HTML form in the website, with a **Latitude** coordinate of **-6.175215683888003** and a **Longitude** coordinate of **106.82712974688135**, the website will identify the closest location as the **National Museum of Indonesia**, located approximately **0.62 kilometers** away by the Haversine Formula method.

Moreover, feel free to input location data situated near the listed "Company's Branches" locations mentioned above.
